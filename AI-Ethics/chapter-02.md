# Chapter 2: Designing Actionable Ethical Frameworks for AI

## 2.1 Framework Fundamentals

### **Core Non-Negotiable Components**

At the core of any ethical framework for AI development are several non-negotiable components that guide their structure and implementation:

#### **1Beneficence**
- **Definition:** Ensuring AI technologies are designed primarily to benefit people and enhance human well-being
- **Application:** AI systems should actively improve quality of life and productivity
- **Implementation:** Design for positive impact, continuous improvement, and stakeholder engagement

#### **2Non-Maleficence**
- **Definition:** Cautions against causing harm, whether through direct action or unintentional neglect
- **Application:** Prevent negative consequences and protect users from potential risks
- **Implementation:** Risk assessment, robust security measures, transparency, and limitations

#### **3. Justice**
- **Definition:** Demands that AI technologies operate fairly and without bias, offering equal opportunity and consideration to all users
- **Application:** Ensure fair and equitable treatment across all demographics
- **Implementation:** Bias mitigation, inclusive access, and fair distribution of benefits

#### **4y**
- **Definition:** Respects the right of individuals to make informed decisions about how AI technologies impact their lives
- **Application:** Users should have control over their interactions with AI systems
