# Multimodular RAG for Drone Technology

This chapter explores how to build a modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for drone technology, integrating both textual and image data. The system leverages LlamaIndex, Deep Lake, and OpenAI LLMs to process and generate responses from multimodal datasets.

## Chapter Summary

This chapter presents a step-by-step approach to building an educational, modular RAG question-answering system for drone technology. The system is designed to handle both text and image data using a modular architecture, as illustrated in Figure 4.1 (A Multimodal Modular RAG System). The workflow includes:

- Loading and indexing textual and image datasets (using Deep Lake and LlamaIndex)
- Initializing the LLM query engine and defining user input for both text and multimodal queries
- Retrieving relevant data and generating responses with OpenAI LLMs
- Merging outputs from text and image modules for comprehensive answers
- Evaluating system performance using defined metrics

The process is modular and extensible, allowing for the integration of new data types and tasks. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of performance metrics and provides practical code examples for loading datasets and building the system in Python.

## Overview

A modular RAG system consists of distinct components, each responsible for handling specific data types and tasks:
- **Text Module:** Processes and retrieves information from textual datasets using LLMs.
- **Image Module:** Manages and analyzes image data, identifying and labeling objects within drone images.

The integration of these modules enables the system to generate comprehensive responses by combining insights from both text and images.

## Key Technologies
- **Deep Lake (Activeloop):** Efficiently manages and stores multimodal data.
- **LlamaIndex:** Indexes and retrieves relevant information from both text and image datasets.
- **OpenAI LLMs:** Generates natural language responses and augments user queries.

## What is Multimodal Data?
Multimodal data combines various forms of information—such as text, images, audio, and video—to enrich data analysis and interpretation. In this system, we focus on text and images to enhance the quality of generated responses.

## What is a Modular System?
A modular system is composed of independent modules, each designed to handle a specific data type or task. This architecture allows for:
- Flexibility in integrating new data types
- Scalability for larger datasets
- Enhanced response generation by leveraging specialized modules

## System Architecture

- The system contains two main datasets:
  - **Textual Dataset:** Contains information about drones.
  - **Image Dataset:** Contains drone images with object labels.
- The workflow involves:
  1. Loading and indexing both datasets using Deep Lake and LlamaIndex.
  2. Defining user input for both text and image queries.
  3. Retrieving relevant data based on the query.
  4. Generating responses using OpenAI LLMs, merging outputs from both modules as needed.
  5. Evaluating system performance using defined metrics.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Data Analysis:** By combining text and images, the system provides richer, more informative responses.
- **Modular Design:** Each module can be developed, tested, and improved independently.
- **Scalability:** Easily extend the system to include additional data types or tasks.
