# Chapter 3: Building Index-Based RAG with LlamaIndex, Deep Lake, and OpenAI

## Chapter Overview

This chapter explores how indexes transform retrieval-augmented generative AI by adding transparency and traceability to RAG systems. Indexes not only improve precision and speed but also provide full visibility into the data sources used for generating responses, addressing critical concerns around bias, hallucinations, copyright, and data integrity.

## Why Use Index-Based RAG?

Index-based search elevates RAG-driven generative AI to advanced levels by addressing fundamental limitations of traditional approaches:

### Key Advantages
- **Enhanced Speed**: Dramatically increases retrieval speed when processing large data volumes
- **Data Organization**: Transforms raw data chunks into organized, indexed nodes
- **Full Traceability**: Enables complete tracking from output back to source document and location
- **Advanced Architecture**: Provides sophisticated structure beyond simple vector-based similarity search

### Index-Based vs Vector-Based Search
The chapter will analyze the architectural differences between:
- **Vector-based similarity search**: Basic semantic matching
- **Index-based search**: Advanced retrieval with organizational structure and traceability

This foundation sets the stage for understanding how index-based RAG systems provide superior performance, organization, and transparency compared to traditional approaches.
